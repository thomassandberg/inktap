Tap handle with a integrated ePaper display

This tap handle uses a ePaper display that do not require a battery or additional hardware.
It is updated using the app "NFC E-Tag" for iOS and Android.

You'll also find the file for 3D printing the handle itself in this repo.
This is the first version of the handle. Feel free to provide updated designs :)

Glue is used to install the display inside the 3d printed handle.

Video coming soon.
